            Our group made an mobile phone app interface for the startup
            <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/nftscoring">NFTScoring </a>, 
            which is an NFT buying and selling platform. We think that this interface 
            will affect anybody who is interested in owning NFTs or people trying
            to learn more about NFTs in general. These people will be effected because
            our app is designed to be a user-friendly, and welcoming platform designed
            for people with little to no experience with NFTs to those that know them 
            in and out.
